# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Currently the code randomly selects a word from a list and asks the user to guess a letter. Input in the wrong format displays an error message to the user.
